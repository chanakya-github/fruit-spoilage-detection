Project Title:
Smartphone-Based Food Spoilage Detection Using Machine Learning

Description:
This project uses image processing and machine learning techniques
to classify food items as fresh or spoiled using images.

A Random Forest classifier is trained using color-based features
extracted from food images.

The system includes:
- Image preprocessing
- Feature extraction
- Machine learning classification
- A simple Streamlit-based user interface

Technologies Used:
- Python
- OpenCV
- scikit-learn
- Streamlit

Note:
Dataset and deep learning experiments were conducted separately
for academic comparison and are not included in this repository.
